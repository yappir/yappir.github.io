If your chatbot isn't giving the answers you expect, please check the following:
- Make sure the page with the answer to your question is included in the 
  chatbot's training.
- Check if there are any pending tasks in the documents section.
- Sometimes, there might be multiple pages with similar information but 
  different answers. Ensure that all pages with relevant information provide the
  same answer.

It's a good idea to remove the following pages from the training documents:
- Home Page (usually contains marketing material)
- Sign-up Page
- Login Page
- Password Reset Page
