A document, page, or webpage in Yappir refers to a piece of text on your 
website. Yappir finds and uses the main text from the webpage but ignores 
headers, footers, and other extra text on your website when training the 
chatbot.

Yappir can read different types of text on your website, like tables,lists, and 
blocks of code. This means the bot can understand a variety of information to 
answer your customers' questions. Yappir's AI capabilities help it understand 
the context of the information it reads, so it can provide accurate and helpful 
responses to your customers' inquiries.
